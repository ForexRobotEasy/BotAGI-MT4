# BotAGI MT4

BotAGI MT4 is an automated forex trading tool that allows traders to automate their trading activities, identify profitable trading opportunities, and integrate the bonus EA offer. This code implements the necessary trade functions and features for the Neuro FX EA product, which is designed for use in the MT4 platform.

## Input Parameters

- `StopLoss`: The stop loss in pips. Default value is 50.0.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit in pips. Default value is 100.0.

## Trade Function

The `Trade` function is responsible for opening a position with the specified lot size and price. It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the input parameters and then calls the `OrderSend` function to open a buy order. If the order is opened successfully, it prints a message indicating the price at which the order was opened. Otherwise, it prints an error message with the error code.

## Trade Opportunity Identification Algorithm

The `IdentifyTradeOpportunity` function is where you can implement your own algorithm logic to identify profitable trading opportunities. You can use technical indicators, market trends, price movements, etc. to determine when to open a trade. The function should return true if a trade opportunity is identified, otherwise it should return false.

## Bonus EA Integration

The `IntegrateBonusEA` function is where you can add your code to integrate the bonus EA offer. This can include accessing additional trading strategies and tools to enhance your trading experience.

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is called once when the EA is attached to a chart. It is used to initialize the necessary components and settings for the EA. You can add your own initialization code here.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. It checks for trade opportunities by calling the `IdentifyTradeOpportunity` function with the current bid price. If a trade opportunity is identified, it generates a random lot size between 0.01 and 0.1 and calls the `Trade` function to open a buy trade at the current market price.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the EA is removed from the chart. It is used to clean up any resources or perform any necessary actions before the EA is removed.
